        <h2>Repeated failure to report income&nbsp;penalty</h2>
        <p>You may have to pay a federal and provincial or territorial penalty if you fail to report an amount of <strong>$500 or more</strong>&nbsp;on your:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2024 tax&nbsp;return</li>
            <li>2021, 2022 or 2023 tax returns</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The penalty is <strong>whichever amount is&nbsp;less:</strong></p>

            <li>10% of the amount that you failed to report (federal and provincial or&nbsp;territorial)</li>
            <li>
                50% of the difference between:
                <ul>
