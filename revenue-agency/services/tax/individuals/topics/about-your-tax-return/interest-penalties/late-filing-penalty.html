    <h2 class="h4">Capital Gains</h2>
    <p>On March 21, 2025, the Government of Canada <a href="https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2025/03/21/prime-minister-mark-carney-cancels-proposed-capital-gains-tax-increase" aria-label="Prime Minister Carney cancels proposed capital gains tax increase">announced</a> that it: </p>
    <ul class="mrgn-tp-md">
        <li>does not intend to proceed with a proposed increase to the capital gains inclusion rate; and</li>
        <li>will maintain the proposed increase in the Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption limit to $1,250,000 on the sale of small business shares and farming and fishing property, and introduce legislation affecting this change in Parliament in due course.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mrgn-tp-md">The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has already reverted to administering the currently enacted capital gains inclusion rate of one-half. Changes to CRAâ€™s systems and the corresponding certification of tax software have been finalized for the reporting of capital dispositions therefore impacted returns can now be submitted and processed.</p>
    <p>The CRA will grant relief in respect of late-filing penalties and arrears interest until <span class="nowrap">June 2, 2025</span>, for impacted T1 Individual filers and until <span class="nowrap">May 1, 2025</span>, for impacted T3 Trust filers to provide additional time for taxpayers reporting capital dispositions to meet their tax filing obligations. This relief extends to any forms and/elections that are normally included with the T1 and T3 returns (e.g.: Foreign Reporting Forms, including <a href="/content/canadasite/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t1135.html">Form T1135, Foreign Income Verification Statement</a>). For the T3 Trust filers, relief extends to the Schedule 15 (<a href="/content/canadasite/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t3sch15.html">T3SCH15 Beneficial Ownership Information of a Trust</a>) and Schedule 130 (<a href="/content/canadasite/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t3sch130.html">T3SCH130 Excessive Interest and Financing Expenses Limitation - Canada.ca</a>) as well. </p>

        <p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> may charge a penalty if any of the following applies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You filed your return late and owe tax for 2024</li>
            <li>You failed to report an amount on your <span class="nowrap">2024 return</span> and also failed to report an amount on your return for 2021, 2022 or 2023</li>
            <li>You knowingly, or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence, made a false statement or an omission on your <span class="nowrap">2024 return</span></li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="toc0">Interest on your balance owing</h2>
        <p>If you have a balance owing for 2024, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will charge you compound daily interest on any unpaid amount owing for 2024 starting the day after the balance is due. This includes any balance owing if the CRA reassesses your return.</p>
        <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>
                <details>
                    <summary>If April&nbsp;30 is on a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday</summary>
                    <p>When a due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday or <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/public-holidays.html">public holiday</a> recognized by the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>, your return is considered on time if the&nbsp;CRA receives it or if it is postmarked on or before the next business day. Your payment is considered on time if it is received by the first business day after the due date. For more information, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/important-dates-individuals.html">Due dates and payments dates</a>.</p>
                </details>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The interest rate that the&nbsp;CRA charges on current or previous balances owing can change every three&nbsp;months based on <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/prescribed-interest-rates.html">prescribed interest&nbsp;rates</a>.</p>
        <h3>Tax instalment interest</h3>
        <p>If the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> requires you to pay tax instalments, you must pay the instalments by the instalment payment due dates.</p>
        <p>If you miss any of these <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/payments/payments-cra/individual-payments/income-tax-instalments/due-dates.html">payment due dates</a>, you may have to pay <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/payments/payments-cra/individual-payments/income-tax-instalments/interest-penalty-charges.html#toc0">instalment interest</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="toc1">Penalty for filing your tax return&nbsp;late</h2>
        <p>If you file your tax return after the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/important-dates-individuals/filing-dates-tax-return.html">due&nbsp;date</a> and have a balance owing, you will be charged a <span class="nowrap">late-filing</span> penalty. Filing late may also cause delays to your benefit and credit&nbsp;payments.</p>
        <p>If you <strong>cannot</strong> pay your balance owing, you should still file on time to avoid being charged the <span class="nowrap">late-filing</span>&nbsp;penalty.</p>
        <p>
            The <span class="nowrap">late-filing</span> penalty is <strong>5%</strong> of your <span class="nowrap">2024 balance</span> owing, <strong>plus an <span class="nowrap">additional 1%</span></strong> for each full month that you file after the due date, to a maximum of <span class="nowrap">12&nbsp;months</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> charged you a <span class="nowrap">late-filing</span> penalty for 2021, 2022 or 2023 and requested a formal demand for a return, your <span class="nowrap">late-filing</span> penalty for 2024 will be <strong>10%</strong> of your balance owing. You will be charged an <strong><span class="nowrap">additional 2%</span></strong> for each full month that you file after the due date, to a maximum of <span class="nowrap">20&nbsp;months</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <span class="nowrap">late-filing</span> penalty still applies when you get <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/taxes/income-tax/personal-income-tax/covid19-taxes/interest-relief.html">interest relief if you received <span class="nowrap">COVID-19</span> benefits</a> <span class="label label-warning">Archived</span>.
        </p>
        <h3>Tax instalment penalty</h3>
        <p>You may have to pay a penalty if your instalment payments are late or <strong>less than</strong> the required amount. The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> applies the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/payments/payments-cra/individual-payments/income-tax-instalments/interest-penalty-charges.html#toc1">instalment penalty</a> only if your instalment interest charges for 2025 are <strong>more than $1,000</strong>.</p>
        <h2 id="toc2">Request to cancel or waive penalties or interest</h2>
        <p>You can make a request to the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> to cancel or waive penalties or interest if you are unable to meet your tax obligations due to circumstances beyond your control.</p>
        <p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> can only grant relief within <span class="nowrap">10 years</span> of&nbsp;your request date.</p>
