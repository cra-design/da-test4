                        <h4>Step 2: Total income</h4>

Do not include this income in Step 2 of your tax return.

                        <p>There are many certified tax software you can choose from to do your taxes, some of which are free, and each is a bit different. When using a software, you will answer some questions at the start of the process about your personal situation. Some software makes suggestions based on the questions you answered, while others do not provide suggestions and require you to enter certain amounts yourself.</p>
                        <p>Most software guide you through the process so you do not miss out on any deductions, credits or benefits that you may be entitled to. However, it is always a good idea to know what is available to make sure you are not missing out.</p>
                        <p>If you are using certified tax software, it will do the calculations for you automatically and may not show the individual steps.</p>
                        <p>Most software advise you of any issues or errors with your tax return so you can correct them before submitting the return to the CRA. Although the software does the calculations for you, you are ultimately responsible for the tax return that you submit, so it is important to understand how the calculations are completed.</p>

                        <p>It is very important to <strong>do your taxes every year, even if you had no income in the year</strong>.</p>
                        <p>The CRA uses the information from your taxes to determine if you are entitled to a tax refund or any benefit and credit payments, like the goods and services tax / harmonized sales tax (GST/HST) credit or the Canada child benefit.</p>
                        <p>Other government departments also use information from your tax return to calculate other payments. For example, Service Canada uses the information to calculate the guaranteed income supplement (GIS) for adults 65 or older. Not filing your taxes by the due date will interrupt your GIS payments.</p>

                        <p>If you became a resident of Canada in the tax year, you must provide your date of entry. If you left Canada in the tax year and became a resident of another country, you must provide your date of departure.</p>
                        <h4>Residing on the settlement lands of Indigenous governments</h4>
                        <p>In some provinces and territories, you are required to answer questions to identify if you resided on the settlement lands of an Indigenous government on December 31 of the tax year.</p>
                        <p>These Indigenous governments are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Nunatsiavut Government (in <strong>Newfoundland and Labrador</strong>)</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Only the tax return for the provinces or territories that are listed above will include questions about residence on settlement lands.</p>
                        <h4>Exempt income</h4>
                        <p>You must let the CRA know whether you have any income that is exempt from tax under section 87 of the <em>Indian Act</em>.</p>
                        <p>If you check this box, you must fill out Form T90, Income Exempt from Tax under the Indian Act, so the CRA can calculate your Canada workers benefit, if it applies, and your family's provincial or territorial benefits. The CRA will also use the information you provide on Form T90 to calculate your Canada training credit limit.</p>
                        <p><strong>Note</strong>: The CRA uses the term "Indian" because it has a legal meaning in the <em>Indian Act</em>.</p>

                            <p>While doing her taxes using certified tax software, Ruman indicated she is married and a resident of Ontario. Her marital status prompted the software to ask her for her spouse’s SIN and net income. Her province of residence prompted the software to ask additional questions related to Form ON-BEN, Application for the Ontario Trillium Benefit, and Ontario Senior Homeowners’ Property Tax Grant, because this form applies only to residents of Ontario.</p>

                        <p>The taxes that you might owe are calculated based on your income. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) operates several review programs to make sure that your income is reported correctly. If you do not report all of your income, you may have to pay penalties and interest as well as the tax you should have paid on the missing income.</p>

                        <p>Most income you receive will be reported on an information slip, sometimes called a tax slip. This is a tax document given to you by whoever paid you the income, such as your employer or financial institution. Your income information is reported on the slip in numbered boxes that each refer to a specific line on the tax return. Each information slip has instructions about where to report the amounts on your tax return.</p>

                        <p>Different types of income are reported on different slips, so you might receive multiple slips if you had more than one source of income.</p>
                        <p>Even though not all your income may be reported on an information slip, such as tips or occasional earnings, you are still responsible for reporting it on your tax return. You should keep track of all the money you earn throughout the year, especially tips that are not recorded on your paystubs, so you are ready at tax time.</p>

                        <h4>Employment income</h4>
                        <p>You’ll receive a T4 slip if you earned or received income from your employer, such as salary, wages, commissions, bonuses, or tips. You will see the amount to report on your tax return in box 14 of your T4 slip.</p>
                        <h4>Other employment income, including direct tips</h4>
                        <p>This amount most commonly includes cash tips paid directly to you because you won’t receive an information slip for them. This amount also includes occasional earnings, such as from babysitting or other odd jobs.</p>
                        <p>If you are self-employed and earn income through independent work, that income is not reported in this section. For more information on being self-employed, take the module: <strong>Working for yourself</strong>.</p>
                        <div class="well brdr-rds-0">
                            <p class="h4 mrgn-tp-0">Exempt income</p>
                            <p>If you are registered or entitled to be registered under the <em>Indian Act</em>, you may have earned or received tax-exempt employment or self-employment income that will be reported on a T4 slip. You will see the amounts in boxes 71 or 88. You should not report these amounts on your tax return. Instead, report them on Form T90, Income Exempt from Tax under the <em>Indian Act</em>. The CRA will use the information you give on Form T90 to calculate certain benefits and credits.</p>
                            <p><strong>Note</strong>: The Canada Revenue Agency uses the term “Indian” because it has a legal meaning in the <em>Indian Act</em>.</p>
                            <p>For more information, see “Tax-exempt income” in part 6 of 8 of this lesson.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>You are responsible for reporting all income earned or received, including in cash, even if you did not receive an information slip.</p>
                        <h4>Employment insurance and other benefits</h4>
                        <p>If you received benefits from Service Canada, such as EI or tuition assistance, you’ll receive a T4E slip. You will see the amount to report on your tax return in box 14.</p>
                        <h4>Interest and other investment income</h4>
                        <p>If you received this type of income from your bank or financial institution, you’ll usually receive a T5 slip, Statement of Investment Income. It uses various box numbers to report income.</p>
                        <p>You <strong>may not</strong> receive a T5 slip if the amount is less than $50, but you must still report the income. You should check your financial statements to confirm if you received this type of income during the year.</p>
                        <h4>Scholarships, fellowships, bursaries, and artists' project grants</h4>
                        <p>If you received any of these amounts during the year, you will receive a T4A slip. The full payments you received are shown in box 105. However, you may not need to report the entire amount on your tax return, depending on the type of scholarship received, what kind of education program you are enrolled in, and whether you are in school full-time or part-time.</p>

Educational assistance payments (EAP) are shown in box 042 and accumulated income payments (AIP) are shown in box 040. A refund of contributions is not shown on a slip, as these payments are not taxable and do not need to be reported on your tax return.</p>

                        <p>If you received social assistance, from your provincial or territorial government, you’ll receive a T5007 slip. The amount to report on your tax return is in box 11.</p>
                        <p>While these payments are not taxable, you must report them to make sure any benefits you may be entitled to are calculated correctly. You will claim an offsetting deduction for the same amount in step 3 so you don’t pay any tax on this income. If you are using certified tax software, it will automatically calculate the amount of this offsetting deduction.</p>
                        <h4>Social assistance payments from a First Nation or band council</h4>
                        <p>If you are registered or entitled to be registered under the <em>Indian Act</em> and you received social assistance payments from your First Nation or band council, you do not need to pay tax on those payments. Fill in the amount you received on Form T90, Income Exempt from Tax under the <em>Indian Act</em>. These payments are tax-exempt so don’t include them in Step 2 of the tax return.</p>
                        <p>For more information, see “Tax-exempt income” in part 6 of 8 of this lesson.</p>
                        <h4>Income from the platform economy</h4>
                        <p>The platform economy includes income earned through online activities such as sharing accommodation, buying and selling or providing freelance services. Income can also be earned through revenue from advertisements or product promotion through videos or pictures. If you participate in the platform economy, you may be self-employed.</p>

                        <h4>Tax-exempt income</h4>
                        <p>It is important to <strong>do your taxes every year, even if your exempt income is not reported on your tax return</strong>. This is true for anyone registered or entitled to be registered as an Indian under the <em>Indian Act</em> with tax-exempt income under section 87 of the <em>Indian Act</em>. This lets the CRA determine if you are entitled to a tax refund or to any benefit and credit payments.</p>
                        <p>You may also need to complete Form T90, Income Exempt from Tax Under the <em>Indian Act</em>, so the CRA can calculate your Canada training credit limit and your Canada workers benefit, if applicable. This form may also be used to calculate your family’s provincial or territorial benefits.</p>

                        <p>Before doing your taxes, you must gather all available information about your income. This includes all of your information slips, as well as details about any income not reported on a slip, such as occasional earnings.</p>
                        <p>If you did not receive a slip in time to do your taxes, talk to the issuer before contacting the CRA. You can also access your slips in My Account. If you cannot get a copy of your slip, you can estimate your income using your paystubs or other financial statements.</p>
                        <div class="well brdr-rds-0">
                            <p class="h4 mrgn-tp-0">Example: Income earned as cash</p>
                            <p>Paola worked at a restaurant as a server and received a T4 slip showing $8,000 of employment income in box 14. Paola’s employer did not track cash tips, so these were not reported on Paola’s paystubs or T4 slip. However, Paola kept a record of what tips she received and knows the total amount was $1,000 for the year. When Paola did her taxes, she entered the amounts in the boxes on her T4 slip and the information about her tips into the certified tax software.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>Certain boxes are for reference purposes only and the amounts they contain do not need to be reported on the tax return, as these amounts are already included in another amount. As in the example of a T4 slip, box 14 already includes amounts shown in other boxes, such as box 30, 32, 34 and 40. You can view the back of a T4 slip to see all the income that you do not report on your tax return.</p>

                        <p>If you are using certified tax software to do your taxes, the software asks you questions about your income. Each software is different. Some may ask if you had certain types of income, what specific slips you have, or if you have any income not reported on a slip. You have to enter the amounts shown in the boxes of your slips, as well as information about any income not shown on a slip. The software adds up the amounts for the same income types and puts the total on the appropriate lines.</p>
                        <p>It is your responsibility to make sure that you review the information you have entered into the certified tax software before you submit your tax return to the CRA.

Because the taxes you owe are calculated using your income, deductions reduce the amount of tax that you may have to pay. Some deductions reduce your net income and others reduce your taxable income.</p>

                            <p>Haru has a total income of $22,000 and paid $300 for union dues, which are shown in box 44 on his T4 slip, Statement of Remuneration Paid. Haru can claim his union dues as a deduction on his tax return.</p>
                            <p>When Haru enters all the amounts from his T4 slip into the certified tax software, the software calculates a deduction for the union dues. Because this deduction is claimed in step 3 of the tax return, it reduces Haru’s net income to $21,700 ($22,000 total income minus the $300 deduction). Haru does not claim any deductions in step 4 of the tax return, so his taxable income is also $21,700.</p>

                        <h4>Registered pension plan (RPP) contributions</h4>
                        <p>An RPP is a pension plan that your employer sets up and registers with the CRA. The purpose of an RPP is to provide you with a pension when you retire.</p>
                        <p>Usually, your employer deducts your RPP contributions from your pay cheque on a regular basis, and the total amount is shown in box 20 of your T4 slip. It may also appear on other receipts, as well as in box 32 of a T4A slip, Statement of Pension, Retirement, Annuity, and Other Income.</p>
                        <p>If you are using certified tax software, you enter the amount shown on your information slips or receipts, and the software enters the total on the correct line.</p>
                        <h4>Registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) contributions</h4>
                        <p>An RRSP is a retirement savings and investment plan that individuals can open and contribute to. Deductible RRSP contributions can be used to reduce your income tax.</p>
                        <p>Your financial institution reports the amount of your contributions on a contribution receipt.</p>
                        <p>You will need to know the amount of your contributions and your RRSP deduction limit for the year. You can find your RRSP deduction limit on your My Account or on your latest notice of assessment. If you are using certified tax software, the software may ask you if you want to claim a deduction for the contributions. It will then calculate (on a Schedule 7, RRSP, PRPP, and SPP Unused Contributions, transfers, and HBP or LLP Activities) your deduction and enter it on the correct line.</p>

Usually, your employer deducts your union dues from your pay cheque on a regular basis, and the total amount is shown in box 44 of a T4 slip. It may also appear on other receipts.</p>
                        <p>If you are using certified tax software, you will enter the amount shown on your slips or receipts, and the software will enter the sum on the correct line.</p>
                        <h4>Child care expenses</h4>

                        <ul>
                            <li>you moved to work or to run a business, or you moved to study as a full-time student enrolled in a post-secondary program at a university, college or other educational institution</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>If you are using certified tax software, it may ask if you have any moving expenses. The software may also ask you about your move or your expenses to confirm you are eligible for the deduction. It will then calculate (on a Form T1-M, Moving Expenses Deduction) your deduction and enter it on the correct line.</p>

                        <h4>Other payments deduction</h4>
                        <p>You should calculate the other payments deduction for the following types of non-taxable income:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>workers' compensation benefits</li>
                            <li>social assistance payments</li>
                            <li>net federal supplements</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If you are using certified tax software, it will automatically calculate the other payments deduction based on the amounts you have reported for the 3 types of income listed above. Generally, the deduction is equal to the sum of these income amounts.</p>
                        <h4>Northern residents deductions</h4>
                        <p>The northern residents deductions consists of 2 parts:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a residency deduction (for living costs)</li>
                            <li>a travel deduction</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You may qualify if you lived in a prescribed northern zone (<span class="nowrap">Zone A</span>) or prescribed intermediate zone (<span class="nowrap">Zone B</span>) on a permanent basis a continuous period of at least 6 consecutive months. This period can begin or end in the tax year.</p>
                        <p>If you are using certified tax software, it may recognize that you lived in a prescribed zone based on the address that you entered at the start. It may also ask if you want to claim the northern residents deductions. You may need to answer additional questions to determine if you are eligible to claim these expenses and to calculate the amount you can claim. The software will then calculate (on a Form T2222, Northern Residents Deductions) your deduction and enter it on the correct line.</p>

                        <p>If you are using certified tax software, the software may use information you entered earlier and ask you questions to determine which deductions you may be able to claim. For example, if you indicated that you have a child, the software may ask you questions about your child care expenses.</p>
                        <p>Once you have entered all information applicable to your tax situation, the certified tax software will calculate all the deductions applicable to you. It will automatically calculate your net income and your taxable income by subtracting your deductions from your total income.</p>
                        <p>It is your responsibility to make sure that you review the information you have entered into the certified tax software before you submit your tax return to the CRA. For example, if you claimed child care expenses, check that this deduction is displayed on the appropriate line number.</p>

                        <p>These credits will usually have the same eligibility criteria. Some provinces and territories may also have other non‑refundable tax credits you can claim.</p>
                        <p>Claiming provincial or territorial non-refundable tax credits is part of <strong>Step 6</strong> in filling out your tax return.</p>
                        <p><strong>Note</strong>: If you lived in Quebec on December 31 of the tax year, you will calculate your provincial taxes by completing a separate provincial tax return for Revenu Québec.</p>

                        <p>The value of each non-refundable tax credit varies between tax years. They are adjusted each year to allow for inflation and other factors.</p>

                        <p>The total of your non-refundable tax credits is multiplied by the rate that each federal, provincial, or territorial government apply on non-refundable tax credits. This means that you can claim a certain percentage of each credit. This percentage is pre-determined by each government. The resulting amount lowers the taxes you owe on your income.</p>

                                Isaiah can claim $20,000 of federal non-refundable tax credits. The federal non-refundable tax credit rate is 15%. The amount that will lower the taxes he owes on his income is calculated like this:<br />

                        <p>All individuals are eligible for this credit, and it is automatically calculated for you if you are using certified tax software. If your taxable income is below the basic personal amount, the taxes you owe on your income are reduced to zero.</p>

                        <p>You can claim this credit if you supported your spouse or common-law partner during the tax year. You must reduce the amount of the credit based on their net income.</p>

                        <h4>Tuition amount</h4>
                        <p>You can claim this credit for eligible tuition fees paid to a recognized educational institution. Generally, this includes post‑secondary institutions, such as universities or colleges, or other educational institutions where you gain skills to develop your career, such as a trade school.</p>
                        <p>You calculate the amount you can claim by using the information from the official tax receipt your educational institution provides you. This is most commonly Form T2202, Tuition and Enrolment Certificate. The receipt will show the tuition paid, as well as how many months you attended full-time or part-time. This slip should be available by the end of February following the year you paid the tuition fees.</p>
                        <p>You must report your tuition amounts in the year they were paid so that the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) can update your account. However, you may not need to use all your tuition credits to reduce the taxes you owe that year. This could happen if you had a low income and no taxes to pay.</p>
                        <p>If you don’t need to use all your tuition credits, you can choose to transfer unused credits from the current tax year, up to the allowable maximum, to an eligible individual. This will help reduce the taxes the other individual owes.</p>
                        <p>Whether or not you choose to transfer your unused tuition credits, you can carry forward any unused credits until they are used up. You will need to claim those credits in the first year that you owe taxes. This could be once you start working full-time after you have graduated. Claiming these credits will reduce the taxes you owe on your income.</p>

                        <p>If you are using certified tax software, you will need to indicate if you are a student with tuition amounts to claim. You will enter the information from your T2202, as well as any amounts carried forward from a previous year. The software will prompt you to answer questions, such as if you want to transfer an unused amount to an eligible individual (such as a parent or a legal guardian). The software will then calculate (on a Schedule 11, Federal Tuition, Education, and Textbook Amounts and Canada Training Credit) the amount to claim on your tax return and enter it on the correct line. This amount will either reduce the taxes you owe to zero or use up your available credits.</p>

                            <p>Shakira’s T2202 shows total tuition fees of $8,000 paid. Shakira did not have any income and so does not owe any tax. Because she does not need to use any of her tuition amount to reduce her taxes owing, Shakira can choose to transfer up to the maximum amount. Shakira chooses to transfer the maximum $5,000 to one of her parents. The software indicates that Shakira has $3,000 ($8,000 <strong class="fa-lg" aria-hidden="true">−</strong><span class="wb-inv">minus</span> $5,000) of credits to carry forward.</p>

                        <h4>Medical expenses</h4>
                        <p>You can claim this credit for eligible medical expenses paid for yourself, your spouse or common-law partner, and eligible dependants. These expenses include prescription drugs, eyeglasses, or hearing aids.</p>
                        <p>You calculate the actual amount you can claim by deducting 3% of your net income (up to the annual maximum) from the amount of medical expenses paid.</p>

                        <h4>Disability amount</h4>
                        <p>You may be able to claim this amount if you have a severe and prolonged impairment in physical or mental functions. To make the claim on your tax return, you must have applied and been approved for the disability tax credit (DTC). You may also be able to claim an amount transferred from a dependant who is eligible for the DTC.</p>
                        <p>If you are using certified tax software, you will need to indicate that you have a DTC approved by the CRA. Based on the responses you provide, the software will claim an amount on the correct line.</p>
                        <p>If you do not need the entire DTC amount to reduce your tax payable, you may transfer some or all of it to a supporting family member.</p>

                            <p>To apply for the DTC, you or your legal representative and your medical practitioner must complete the Form T2201, Disability Tax Credit Certificate. Medical practitioners may use the DTC digital application to complete their portion of the form. Once the form is completed and signed by both parties, you submit it to the CRA.</p>

                        <p>The next step is to calculate your non-refundable tax credits. You will then subtract your federal non-refundable tax credits from the total taxes you calculated on your income. The result of this calculation is your net federal tax.</p>
                        <h4>Basic personal amount</h4>
                        <p>The first federal non-refundable tax credit is the basic personal amount. The basic federal personal amount is $16,129 for the 2025 tax year. In general, anyone with a taxable income below this amount does not have to pay federal income tax.</p>
                        <div class="well brdr-rds-0">
                            <p class="h4 mrgn-tp-0">Example: The basic personal amount</p>
                            <p>The federal taxes Giovanni calculated on his income will be completely eliminated, because he had taxable income of less than $16,129.</p>
                            <p>Maria will subtract the basic personal amount from the federal taxes she calculated on her income because her income is more than $16,129. She may be able to claim other non-refundable tax credits that will further reduce the taxes that she owes.</p>
                        </div>
                        <h4>The non-refundable tax credit rate</h4>
                        <p>Your non-refundable tax credits are also multiplied by a non‑refundable tax credit rate. This means that you do not apply the full value of your non-refundable tax credits against the taxes you owe on your income. A percentage, pre-determined by the government, lowers the taxes you owe on your income.</p>

                            <h4>Step 6: Refund or balance owing</h4>
                            <ul class="fa-ul">
                                <li>Total payable</li>
                                <li class="brdr-bttm pull-left"><strong class="fa-li fas fa-lg fa-fw" aria-hidden="true">−</strong><span class="wb-inv">minus</span> Total credits</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>The first amount is your <strong>total payable</strong>, which is the sum of all the amounts you owe. This is usually made up of your federal and provincial or territorial taxes.</p>
                            <p><strong>Note</strong>: If you lived in Quebec on December 31 of the tax year, you will calculate your provincial taxes by completing a separate provincial tax return for Revenu Québec.</p>
                            <p>The second amount is your <strong>total credits</strong>, which includes your refundable tax credits. Refundable tax credits reduce the amount you owe to zero first and, unlike non-refundable tax credits, any remaining credit is refunded to you.</p>
                            <p>The difference between these amounts is known as your <strong>refund</strong>, where the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) owes you an amount, or your <strong>balance owing</strong>, where you must pay an amount to the CRA.</p>

                                <p>This amount applies only to individuals who lived in Quebec on December 31 of the tax year. If you earned income outside Quebec during the year, you may transfer up to 45% of the income tax deducted from any of your sources of income outside Quebec to the Province of Quebec.</p>
                                <p>If you are using certified tax software, it will ask you if you would like to transfer any eligible amounts.</p>
                                <p><strong>Refundable Quebec abatement</strong></p>
                                <p>This amount allows most residents of Quebec on December 31 of the tax year to claim 16.5% of their basic federal tax as a credit.</p>
                                <p>If you are using certified tax software to do your taxes, it will automatically calculate this credit if you are eligible.</p>
