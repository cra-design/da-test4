<h2 id="a1">Overview</h2>
<p>The child disability benefit (CDB) is a tax-free monthly payment made to families who care for a child under age 18 with a severe and prolonged impairment in physical or mental functions.</p>
<h2 id="a2">Eligibility</h2>
<p>To get the CDB:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You must be eligible for the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/canada-child-benefit-overview.html">Canada child benefit (CCB)</a></li>
    <li>Your child must be eligible for the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/segments/tax-credits-deductions-persons-disabilities/disability-tax-credit.html">disability tax credit (DTC)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are already getting the CCB for your child who is eligible for the DTC, <strong>you do not need to apply </strong>for the CDB. You will get it automatically.</p>
<p>If this is the first time youâ€™re getting the CDB, the CRA will automatically calculate your payments for the current and two previous benefit years. The benefit year runs from July of one year to June of the following year. For years before that, send a written request to your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/address-tax-centre-mail-your-forms.html">tax centre</a>.</p>

    <div class="panel-body">
        <p>A child is eligible for the DTC when a medical practitioner certifies, on <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2201.html">Form T2201, Disability Tax Credit Certificate</a>, that the child has a severe and prolonged impairment in physical or mental functions, and the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) approves the form. You can send the form to the CRA at any time during the year.</p>

<p>For general questions related to the CDB, call <span class="nowrap">1-800-387-1193</span> or for information related to the DTC, call <span class="nowrap">1-800-959-8281</span>.</p>
<h2 id="a3">How much you can expect to receive</h2>
<p>Your CDB payments are calculated using the following information:</p>
<ul>
    <li>number of eligible children</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4114/canada-child-benefit.html#afmlynt">adjusted family net income (AFNI)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Every July, your CDB payments are recalculated based on your AFNI from the previous year.</p>
<p>For example, July 2025 to June 2026 payments are based on your adjusted family net income from your 2024 tax return. <span class="nowrap">July 2024</span>&nbsp;to <span class="nowrap">June 2025</span>&nbsp;payments are based on your adjusted family net income from your 2023 tax return.</p>
<p>For the period of <span class="nowrap">July 2025</span>&nbsp;to <span class="nowrap">June 2026</span>, you could get up to $3,411 ($284.25 per month) for each child who is eligible for the DTC.</p>
<p>The benefit starts being reduced when the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4114/canada-child-benefit.html#afmlynt">adjusted family net income</a> is greater than $81,222. The reduction is calculated as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>For families with one child eligible for the benefit, the reduction is 3.2% of the amount of adjusted family net income greater than $81,222.</li>
    <li>For families with two or more children eligible for the benefit, the reduction is 5.7% of the amount of adjusted family net income greater than $81,222.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can use the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/child-family-benefits-calculator.html">child and family benefits calculator</a> to estimate how much you will get.</p>
<h2 id="a4">To continue getting benefits</h2>
<p>You must remain eligible for the CCB and your child must also remain eligible for the DTC.</p>
<p>To avoid delays or interruption in your benefit payments, you need to do your taxes on time every year, even if you had no income at all or your income is tax exempt. If you have a spouse or common-law partner, they also need to do their taxes on time every year. The CRA uses the information from your income tax and benefit return to calculate your benefit and credit payments.</p>
<p>To make sure you are getting the right amount of benefits and credits, you must also <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/keep-your-information-date.html">keep your personal information updated</a> with the CRA.</p>
